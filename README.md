# Hi, Iâ€™m Jason 

I build things that scale ðŸš€  
With a full-stack mindset, I thrive on turning complex systems into clean, efficient, and maintainable code. My playground spans **Golang â€¢ Java â€¢ Python**, and Iâ€™m equally at home architecting microservices, building high-concurrency backend systems, or deploying end-to-end cloud infrastructure.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack  
- **Languages:** Golang, Java, Python  
- **Backend & Systems:** Microservices, Distributed Systems, REST / gRPC APIs  
- **Infrastructure:** Kubernetes, Docker, Cloud (AWS / GCP / Azure)  
- **Data & Storage:** SQL, NoSQL, Caching, Data Pipelines  
- **DevOps & Automation:** CI/CD, GitOps, Monitoring / Observability  

I approach engineering with a builderâ€™s mindsetâ€”whether Iâ€™m designing system architecture, racing to optimise performance, or laying out the right infrastructure for tomorrowâ€™s growth.  
Always learning. Always building.  

Thanks for stopping by!
